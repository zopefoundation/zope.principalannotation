Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.principalannotation
to remove its dependencies on "zope 3 application server" components.

In addition, the following changes were made after split off:

 - The IAnnotations implementation was fixed to look in the higher-level
   utility not only on ``__getitem__``, but also on ``get`` and ``__nonzero``.

 - Tests was reworked into the README.txt doctest.

 - Added a buildout part that generates Sphinx documentation from the
   README.txt
